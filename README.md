[Predicting CO₂ Emissions of Future Car models](https://www.github.com//Nyawira-Mwangi/Predicting-CO2-Emissions-Future-Car-Models/tree/main) <br>
With the increasing global focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, accurately predicting CO₂ emissions for new car models is crucial. This project aims to build a robust predictive model using polynomial regression and Box-Cox transformation techniques. The model is designed to forecast CO₂ emissions based on features such as engine size, fuel type, vehicle class, and more.<br>

[Aircraft-Engine-Gaseous-Emissions-Clustering](https://github.com/Nyawira-Mwangi/Aircraft-Engine-Gaseous-Emissions-Clustering) <br>
Aircraft engine emissions are a major concern for environmental sustainability. This project aims to cluster aircraft engines based on their gaseous emissions, enabling stakeholders to:
identify emission patterns across different engines ,classify engines with similar emission characteristics, support decision-making for emissions reduction and compliance with net-zero targets.
