[Predicting CO₂ Emissions of Future Car models](https://www.github.com//Nyawira-Mwangi/Predicting-CO2-Emissions-Future-Car-Models/tree/main)
With the increasing global focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, accurately predicting CO₂ emissions for new car models is crucial. This project aims to build a robust predictive model using polynomial regression and Box-Cox transformation techniques. The model is designed to forecast CO₂ emissions based on features such as engine size, fuel type, vehicle class, and more.
